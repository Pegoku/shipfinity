        <p className="box-in">
          Gridfinity is a modular, open-source grid storage system designed for
          workshops and other workspaces to help with organization. It uses a
          standardized grid pattern (42x42mm) and modular bins that can be
          customized to fit various tools, parts, or supplies. The system is
          highly flexible, allowing users to create tailored storage solutions
          that maximize efficiency and minimize clutter.
